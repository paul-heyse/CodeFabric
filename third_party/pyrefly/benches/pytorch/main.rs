//! PyTorch walltime benchmarks. Each benchmark lives in its own module
//! (`cold_start`, `error_propagation`, `full_check`) sharing the checkout harness
//! in [`common`]; this crate root just aggregates their criterion groups into one
//! binary, so a single `pytorch_bench` target builds and runs all of them.
//! Individual benchmarks are still selectable by name at runtime, e.g.
//! `cargo bench -p pyrefly --bench pytorch -- cold_start`.
